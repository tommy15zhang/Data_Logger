# Data_Logger

Data will be sent from the Arduino to the computer in this order

Temp = 
Humidity = 
Air_quality = 
Avg_temp = 
Avg_humidity = 
Avg_air_qual = 
Temp_too_low =
Temp_too _high = 
Humidity_too_low =
Humidity_too_high =
Air_quality_poor =

The actual data will look like this

25,67,40,22,50,38,0,0,1,0,1
